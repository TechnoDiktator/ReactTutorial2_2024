### IN THIS PROJECT I BASICALLY LEARNED HOW TO USE useRef , forwardRef , UseImperativeHandle and ReactPortals by Building a small Game 
### Game rules are simple just click the timer button and press it again before the timer runs out
### The game creates a model on the top when the game is over or it is won by the player
