## ðŸ“Œ 2. Redux Toolkit Revisit

Redux Toolkit Practice 
In this project i used the redux toolkit and redux to do state management instead of in component 
or context state 
Redux allows us to pass state accross all our components at an application level 

I have also used **Custom Action generators , Custom Hooks ,Firebase** 

- **Features Used:**
- FireBase
- Fetch api
  - `useEffect` with cleanup functions and also used custom action generators inside useEffect
  - passed those action generators to the dispatch method returned by useDispatch to run SideEffects (fetch api)
  - Custom Hooks (Built a modular custom hook and used it in multiple components)
  - `useCallback` for optimized performance
  - Modals and Progress Bars
  - fetch api
